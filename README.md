The Fort Museum, which is the only ticketed
institution of the Archaeological Survey of India in
the complex, exhibits many items of the period of
English and later British rule. This building was
completed in 1795 and first housed the office of the
Madras Bank. The hall upstairs was the Public
Exchange Hall and served as a place for public
meetings, lottery draws and occasional entertainment.
These relics are reminders of British rule in India.
The objects on display in the museum are the weapons,
coins, medals, uniforms and other artefacts from
England, Scotland, France and India dating back to
the colonial period. Original letters written by
Clive and Cornwallis make fascinating reading. One
set of quaint period uniforms is displayed for
viewing, as well. However, the pièce de resistance is
a large statue of Lord Cornwallis.
The National Flag of India was designed by Pingali
Venkayya and adopted in its present form during the
meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July
1947, a few days before India's independence from
Britain on 15 August 1947. The first ever flag flown
after the independence is stored in the third floor
of the museum. The public are allowed to see but not
to touch or take photographs.

The Kālikāmbal Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to
Shri Kāligāmbāl (Kāmākshi) and Lord Kamadeswarar,
located in Parry's corner (Old: George Town) locality
of the city of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The temple
is located in Thambu Chetty Street, a prominent
financial street at Georgetown, running parallel to
Rajaji Salai. The temple was originally located
closer to the sea shore at the site of the present-
day Fort St. George. When the British East India
Company built the fort, the temple was relocated to
the current site on 1 March 1640 and the construction
continued until 1678. Chhatrapati Shivaji, the 17th
century Maratha warrior-king and the founder of
Maratha Empire, had paid a visit in this temple on 3
October 1677.It is believed that a fierce form of
Goddess was held in worship earlier and that this
form was replaced with the shanta swaroopa (calm
posture) form of Goddess Kamakshi by Adi Shankara.
Tamil poet Subramaniya Bharathi was a regular visitor
of the temple in the early 20th century
